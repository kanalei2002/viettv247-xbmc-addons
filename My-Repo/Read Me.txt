YOU NEED A GITHUB ACCOUNT, IF YOU HAVENT GOT ONE CREATE ONE!!!!!!!

Hi And welcome to Mikey1234 (revised by Mash2k3 for Github)

1 2 3 Easy Repo

FIRSTLY GET FAMILIAR WITH THE FOLDERISATION OF EVERYTHING I WOULD MAKE 2 COPIES 

1. WHICH IS YOURS
2. WHICH IS IS ORIGINAL 

THAT IS SO YOU CAN COMPARE JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING SETUP CORRECTLY
ONCE SETUP YOU CAN DELETE THE ORIGINAL FOLDER !!!

what you need to change in this repo obviously is everything called "YourRepo"

inside the repository.YourRepo is an addon xml

you need to change the "CHANGEME" to your Github account username !!

you need to change the "My-Repo" to your Github repo name !!

and the "HELLO" TO YOUR NAME

also you will need to edit the addon.xml to your liking !

this is what it looks like

<addon id="repository.ka-kanalei-addons" name="ka kanalei xbmc addons" version="1.0.0" provider-name="ka kanalei"> 
	<extension point="xbmc.addon.repository" name="ka kanalei Addon Repository">                     
		<info compressed="false">https://github.com/kanalei2002/viettv247-xbmc-addons/raw/master/addons.xml</info>    
		<checksum>https://github.com/kanalei2002/viettv247-xbmc-addons/raw/master/addons.xml.md5</checksum>         
		<datadir zip="true">https://github.com/kanalei2002/viettv247-xbmc-addons/raw/master/zips</datadir>            
	</extension>
	<extension point="xbmc.addon.metadata">
		<summary>Install Addons from ka kanalei</summary>
		<description>Video plug-ins for XBMC</description>
		<platform>all</platform>
	</extension>
</addon>


"
ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING YOU WILL NEED TO ZIP UP THE "repository.YourRepo" and name it  "repository.YourRepo-1.0.zip"

and put it in correct folder inside the zips folder , the number "-1.0" represents the version number that is in any addon.xml


obviously you will have to do that with your plugin too !!!!


when you have folderised and zipped everything YOU CAN RUN THE ADDONS_XML_GENERATOR.PY


THAT WILL CHANGE THE MAIN ADDONS.XML TELLING XBMC WHERE TO LOOK AND WHAT VERSION NUMBER OF YOUR PLUGIN IS 

PLUS IT WILL CHANGE THE addons.xml.MD5 so xbmc knows there is a new version of your plugin
